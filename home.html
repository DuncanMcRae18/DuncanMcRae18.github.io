            <p class="intro-text"> Welcome to my site!
                I'm a 4th-year Honours Physics and Electrical Engineering student at the University of Ottawa, specializing in communications.
                I'm building this portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences.

            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>I grew up on a small farm in the little town of <a href="https://www.bing.com/maps?q=Bainsville,+Ontario">Bainsville</a>, Ontario.
                Growing up I learned a great deal about work ethic and gained a mechanical inclination from helping my family maintain and operate
                various types of farm equipment. I was always interested in how things worked, especially electronic systems, so I began my path through post-secondary education at the
                University of Ottawa in 2021.
                <br><br>
                As mentioned, I'm currently in my second-last course-based semester at the University of Ottawa (although I have two CO-OP terms left).
                and as part of my program I am searching for CO-OP opportunities that align with my interests and skills.  I chose to also major in physics as I am ever curious as to why things work the way they do,
                and to suppliment my fascination with electricity and with a specialization in communications.
                <br><br>
                In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects such as this website and microcontroller systems, having completed a few projects
                in those areas during my coursework and on my own time. Like any good farm boy, I also love to visit home and help out; not to mention 
                the constant supply of things to fix and tinker with!
